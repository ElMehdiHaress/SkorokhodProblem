# SkorokhodProblem
Stochastic differential equations can describe many phenomena such as physical systems or thermal fluctuations. Usually when studying a phenomenon, in addition
to having the stochastic equation that describes it, we work in a bounded domain and we want our solution not to exceed some fixed boundary. Theoretically, we want to reflect the solution each time each time it touches the boundary. Otherwise, we don't want to change it. In probability theory and related fields, this problem is known as the Skorokhod problem and has been studied a lot in the past years. In this project, I am interested in proving that the solution to the Skorokhod problem has a density.

Presentation.pdf includes a brief prensentation of SDEs (stochastic differential equations) and the manner in which I tackle the Skorokhod problem. 
Skorokhod.pdf is a report of the work I did, which includes the proof of the existence of the density.
